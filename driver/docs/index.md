# Driver

This section documents the `birch` driver program, used for building and running Birch code. The driver program is partly controlled by command-line arguments, and partly by the `META.json` file included in the directory in which it is run.

The driver program is invoked as follows:

    birch <command> [options]

Each command is documented in this section, along with the options it accepts.
