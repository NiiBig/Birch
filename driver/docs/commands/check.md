Check the file structure of the project for possible issues. This makes no
modifications to the project, but will output warnings for possible issues
such as:

  - files listed in `META.json` that do not exist,
  - files of recognisable types that exist but are not listed in
    `META.json`, and
  - standard meta files that do not exist.
