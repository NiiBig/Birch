/**
 * Cholesky decomposition of a symmetric positive definite matrix, $S = LL^T$.
 *
 * The object acts as the matrix $S$, defines conversion to and assignment
 * from `Real[_,_]`, and is intended as more or less a drop-in replacement
 * for that type, albeit sharing, as usual for objects (i.e. copy-by-reference
 * rather than copy-by-value semantics). That sharing permits, for example,
 * multiple multivariate Gaussian distributions to share the same covariance
 * or precision matrix with common posterior updates performed only once.
 *
 * Various functions, such as `solve`, have overloads that make use of `LLT`
 * objects for more efficient computation.
 *
 * !!! important
 *     To emphasize, the matrix represented is $S$, not $L$, which is to say,
 *     code such as the following:
 *
 *         auto A <- LLT(S);
 *         y <- solve(A, x);
 *
 *     computes the matrix-vector product $y = S^{^-1}x$, not $y = L^{-1}x$,
 *     however the Cholesky decomposition will be used to solve this more
 *     efficiently than a general matrix solve. The point of an `LLT` object
 *     is to maintain the original matrix in a decomposed form for more
 *     efficient computation.
