A thorough treatment of types is deferred to below. There are many categories of types in Birch. Two important categories are:

  1. *Basic types*, such as `Boolean`, `Integer`, `Real`, and `String`.
  2. *Class types* as declared in user code, such as `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, and `Gaussian` from the standard library.

Instantiations of basic types (e.g. variables, expression results) are typically *values*, while those of class types are called *objects*.
