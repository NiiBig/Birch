# Multiple object tracking

A simple multiple object tracking demonstration in the Birch probabilistic programming language. This demonstrates the use of a universal probabilistic programming language for inference on a model without fixed dimension (the number of objects is unknown). Data is simulated from the model and then filtered using a particle filter, within which the delayed sampling heuristic (Murray *et al.* 2018) automatically yields a Kalman filter for the tracking of each object. It is used as an example in Murray & Schön (2018), in which further details are available.
