# MultiObjectTracking package

A simple multiple object tracking demonstration in the Birch probabilistic programming language. Data is simulated from the model and then filtered using a particle filter, within which the delayed sampling features of Birch automatically yield a Kalman filter for the tracking of each object. It is used as an example in Murray & Schön (2018), in which further details are available.
