Documentation for the standard library is readily accessible at <http://www.birch-lang.org>.


## Developer notes

The standard library includes parsers for several file formats that are contained in `*.y` files. The `lemon` parser generator is used to build C sources for these. These C sources are included in the repository so that users of the standard library need not build them themselves. For developers, however, after modifications to any `*.y` files, run `make_parser.sh` manually to rebuild the C sources.
