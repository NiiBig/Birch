   * The second group of flags take the place of the colors described in
   * @ref Bacon2001 "Bacon & Rajan (2001)". The reason is to ensure that both
   * the bookkeeping required during normal execution can be multithreaded,
   * and likewise that the operations required during cycle collection can be
   * multithreaded. The basic principle to ensure this is that flags can be
   * safely set during normal execution (with atomic operations), but should
   * only be unset with careful consideration of thread safety.

   *
   *   - *possible root* maps to *purple*,
   *   - *marked* maps to *gray*,
   *   - *scanned* and *reachable* together map to *black* (both on) or
   *     *white* (first on, second off),
   *   - *collected* is set once a white object has been destroyed.
   *
   * The use of these flags also resolves some thread safety issues that can
   * otherwise exist during the scan operation, when coloring an object white
   * (eligible for collection) then later recoloring it black (reachable); the
   * sequencing of this coloring can become problematic with multiple threads.
