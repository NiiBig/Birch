/**
 * Base class for reference counted objects.
 *
 * @ingroup libbirch
 *
 * @attention In order to work correctly with multiple inheritance, Any must
 * be the *first* base class.
 *
 * Reference-counted objects in LibBirch require four counts, rather than
 * the usual two (shared and weak), in order to support lazy deep copy
 * operations. These are:
 *
 *   - a *shared* count,
 *   - a *memo shared* count,
 *   - a *weak* count, and
 *   - a *memo weak* count.
 *
 * The shared and weak counts behave as normal. The memo shared and memo weak
 * counts serve to determine when an object is only reachable via a memo used
 * to bookkeep lazy deep copy operations. Objects that are only reachable via
 * a memo may be eligible for collection.
 *
 * The movement of the four counts triggers the following operations:
 *
 *   -# When the shared count reaches zero, the object is *discarded*.
 *   -# If the shared count subsequently becomes nonzero again (this is
 *      allowed as long as the memo shared count is nonzero), the object is
 *      *restored*.
 *   -# If the shared and memo shared counts reach 0, the object is
 *      *destroyed*.
 *   -# If the weak and memo weak counts reach 0, the object is *deallocated*.
 *
 * These operations behave as follows:
 *
 *   - **Discard** downgrades all shared pointers in the object to memo
 *     shared pointers.
 *   - **Restore** upgrades those memo shared pointers to shared pointers
 *     again.
 *   - **Destroy** calls the destructor of the object.
 *   - **Deallocate** collects the memory allocated to the object.
 *
 * The discard operation may be skipped when the destroy operation would
 * immediately follow anyway; i.e. when the shared count reaches zero and the
 * memo shared count is already at zero.
 *
 * At a high level, shared and weak pointers serve to determine which objects
 * are reachable from the user program, while memo shared and memo weak
 * pointers are used to determine which objects are reachable via a memo,
 * and to break reference cycles that are induced by the memo, but which
 * do not exist in the user program *per se*.
 *
 * A discarded object is in a state where reference cycles induced by a memo
 * are broken, but it is otherwise still a valid object, and may still be
 * accessible via a weak pointer in the user program.
